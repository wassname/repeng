       "  {'content': \"Yes, the passage contains sufficient information to answer the follow-up question.\\n\\nThe passage explains that rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, and that contact with air and light can contribute to the risk of rancidity. It also mentions that storing the fat in a tightly closed opaque container can help minimize the risk of rancidity.\\n\\nBased on this information, it is reasonable to suggest that storing the grease in the refrigerator would help prolong its shelf life and reduce the risk of rancidity, especially if it is stored in an airtight container. However, it is important to note that even if stored properly, the grease may still go rancid eventually, and it is always best to check for any signs of rancidity before consuming it.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer to the follow-up question would be:\\n\\nFOLLOWUP_A: It's recommended to store the grease in the refrigerator in an airtight container to prolong its shelf life and reduce the risk of rancidity. However, it's still important to check for any signs of rancidity before consuming it.\",\n",
